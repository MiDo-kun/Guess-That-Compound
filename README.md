# Guess That Compound

## Project Overview

Guess That Compound is a fun and educational web application that challenges players to guess the name of a displayed compound within a short amount of time. The application is designed to help users expand their knowledge in the field of science, specifically in the area of chemistry.

The game is simple: the player is presented with a compound name and a set of multiple-choice answers. The player must select the correct answer within a given time limit to score points. The game can be played in different categories, such as selecting covalent and ionic compounds, with each mode presenting compounds of varying complexity.

In addition to the game, the application includes a learning section where users can explore different concepts in science, such as chemical bonding, molecular structure, and nomenclature. This section provides users with a deeper understanding of compounds and their properties and helps them to expand their knowledge in the field.

Overall, Guess That Compound is a great way to learn and have fun at the same time. It is suitable for students, educators, and anyone who wants to learn more about compounds and their properties.

## Main Objectives

The main objectives of this project were to:

- Use Firebase Hosting to deploy the project.
- Gain a better understanding of DOM manipulation in creating dynamic web applications.
- Learn how to use objects to display information in the document.
- Improve logical thinking skills when implementing the features of the application.

## Key Features

The Guess That Compound offers the following key features:

- Allows the user to guess the compound within a limited time.
- Can be played in different modes such as covalent and ionic compounds.
- Learning section where players can expand their knowledge related to science.
- Helps users expand their knowledge of compounds and their properties.

## What I Learned

Through this project, I gained the following knowledge and skills:

- Expanded my knowledge of DOM manipulation in creating dynamic web applications.
- Learned how to import a file and use it as a data input for the questions.
- Learned how to use objects to better organize and retrieve values efficiently.
- Started to understand the purpose of using event loop APIs such as setInterval to implement features in the project.

Overall, this project provided me with a solid foundation in modern web development using JavaScript and related technologies. The skills and knowledge I gained will be useful in future web development projects.
